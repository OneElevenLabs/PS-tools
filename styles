Generate a year-end evaluation summary for the employee based on the following XML data. Structure the feedback by performance pillar. For each performance pillar:

1. Begin with the pillar description to provide context.
2. Compare the employee’s goals with examples from the manager's mid-year and year-end reviews, giving **greater weight to the year-end feedback** where available.
3. Include the manager's **end-of-year rating** and explain how the rating correlates with the feedback provided.
4. Pull relevant peer feedback and categorize it by performance pillar.
5. Highlight any specific examples where the manager’s feedback aligns with the employee's goals, prioritizing the year-end feedback.
6. Organize any unstructured peer feedback by performance pillar.
7. Emphasize key behaviors, achievements, or qualitative data points for each pillar, using year-end feedback as the primary source of assessment.

If the year-end feedback contradicts the mid-year review, prefer the year-end feedback as the more recent and relevant performance indicator.
